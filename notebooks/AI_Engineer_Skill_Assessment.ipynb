    "\n",
    "1. **Serialize and Save the Model**\n",
    "   - Save your selected and trained model as a `.pkl` file named `model.pkl` using an appropriate serialization library (e.g., `joblib` or `pickle`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Load and Test the Saved Model**\n",
    "   - Demonstrate how to load the saved `model.pkl` file.\n",
    "   - Upload or simulate uploading the saved model in your notebook.\n",
    "   - Use the loaded model to generate a test prediction on new (sample) data to verify successful deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Document Your Deployment Strategy**\n",
    "   - Briefly describe your approach for deploying the model in a production environment.\n",
    "   - Discuss reliability, monitoring, maintenance, failure handling, and scalability considerations for VA claim volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Deliverables\n",
