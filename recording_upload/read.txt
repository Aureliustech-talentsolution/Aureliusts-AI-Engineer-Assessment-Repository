I was unable to complete the recording or presentation portion of the assessment due to time constraints, 
and I understand if that affects my evaluation. As someone applying for this AI Engineer role, I recognize 
the importance of communicating results clearly and effectively, and I take full responsibility for not delivering 
that final component. I put a lot of effort into the technical work and hope that my code reflect my skills.
