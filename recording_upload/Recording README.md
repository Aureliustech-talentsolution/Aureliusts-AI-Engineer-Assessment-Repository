# AI Engineer Skill Assessment: Video Submission

Thank you for completing the AI Engineer Skill Assessment. The final step is to prepare and submit a short video presentation summarizing your work. This video is a crucial part of the evaluation, allowing you to demonstrate your communication skills and articulate your technical decisions and business insights.

## Video Requirements

Please prepare a short video (5â€“10 minutes) where you clearly discuss the following:

* **Your Methodology, Challenges, and Solutions:** Walk us through your end-to-end process. Explain the key decisions you made during data exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling. Discuss any significant challenges you encountered and how you overcame them.

* **Key Insights and Model Performance:** Summarize the most important findings from your analysis. Discuss the performance of your final model, explaining the evaluation metrics you chose and what they mean in the context of VA claims.

* **Implications for AI Engineering and Business:** Explain the business value of your model. How could it be used to improve the VA claims process? What are the broader implications of your work from both a technical and a business perspective?

* **Future Recommended Steps:** Outline what you would do next. What future improvements would you recommend for the model? What additional data or features could enhance its predictive power?

## Submission Instructions

Please upload your video recording along with your other submission files (Jupyter notebook, model files, etc.).

If you experience any technical difficulties or are unable to upload your video through the required platform, please email the recording directly to one of the following contacts:

* **Anika Murray**, Operations Manager: anika@aureliusts.com
* **Terrence Calistro**, Lead Data and Analytics Architect: terrence@aureliusts.com

Please ensure your name and "AI Engineer Skill Assessment Video" are in the subject line.

We look forward to reviewing your submission and learning more about your approach to this project.
